    <h3>Various fun facts about the Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwich:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The peanut butter and jelly sandwich (PB&amp;J) has been around for a long time. The recipe for a PB&amp;J has existed as early as 1901. Its predecessor was peanut butter with pimento cheese.</li>
      <li>Maybe one of the reasons that the PB&amp;J is such a big hit is that it has roots in our nation with Thomas Jefferson and Jimmy Carter, two former presidents, being peanut farmers. They may have been the ones that promoted National Peanut Butter Day, which takes place on February 12th, and National Jelly Day, which takes placed on April 2nd.</li>
      <li>The popularity of PB&amp;J continues to grow. In recent years the worldâ€™s largest PB&amp;J sandwich was made as part of the Great American Peanut Butter Festival in Grand Saline, TX. This mammoth sandwich weighed 1,342 pounds.</li>
      <li>There is no reason to be worried about peanut butter shortages with its rise in popularity, a single acre can contain enough peanuts to make 30,000 PB&amp;J sandwiches.</li>
