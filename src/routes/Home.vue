  <div class="row">
    <p class="twelve columns">Welcome! The purpose of this infosite is to raise awareness of the great American symbol: the Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly (PB&amp;J) Sandwich! Much like the Bald Eagle, the Stars &amp; Stripes, or the Statue of Liberty, the PB&amp;J has become inherently connected with American culture. Take a look around and find out more how PB&amp;J sandwiches were engineered to shape and change America!</p>

  <h3>What constitutes a Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwich?</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <p class="twelve columns">The PB&amp;J sandwich is an iconic sandwich that has many variations and adaptations to the original recipe. The authors provide specific criteria that specify what constitutes a PB&amp;J as well as showing acceptable forms of the ubiquitous sandwich.</p> 
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="six columns">
      <h4>A PB&amp;J consists of:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li class="tick"> A grain-based substrate</li>
        <li class="tick"> Peanut butter (PB) and some jam or jelly-like (J) substance on the substrate</li>
        <li class="tick"> A horizontal interface between the PB and the J</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="six columns">
      <h4>A PB&amp;J does not consist of:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li class="cross"> Any substance that detracts from the enjoyment of the partaker</li>
        <li class="cross"> PB substitutes, e.g., Almond Butter, Soynut Butter, Coconut Butter, etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h3>The forms of the PB&amp;J</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <p class="twelve columns">A strength of the PB&amp;J is that it is adaptable to the partakerâ€™s specific taste, as well as the ingredients that are available. One example of the versatility of the PB&amp;J is found in Figure 1, where the grain substrate is two Ritz crackers. However, this strength can quickly become a weakness when the variations of the PB&amp;J become extreme, illustrated by Figure 7.</p>
